# nf-core/circrna: Output

## Introduction

This documentation describes the output of `nf-core/circrna` for the test dataset which runs all 3 modules in the workflow: `circRNA discovery` , `miRNA prediction` and `differential expression` analysis of circular RNAs in RNA-Seq data.  

The processes listed below will fall into one of 4 output directories produced by `nf-core/circrna`:

```console
|-- results/
       |-- quality_control
       |-- circrna_discovery
       |-- mirna_prediction
       |-- differential_expression
```

</details>

`nf-core/circrna` has been designed exclusively with [gencode](https://www.gencodegenes.org/) reference files due to their ubiquitous compatibility with circRNA quantification tools. For this reason, ENSEMBL and UCSC reference files are not recommended. The user can specify which genome version to use (`GRCh37/GRCh38`) via the `--genome_version` parameter, see [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/circrna/dev/parameters#reference-genome-options) for details.

`nf-core/circrna` outputs quality control plots of normalised *log2* expression data from `DESeq2` to assess heterogeneity in the experiment samples. These plots can be useful to assess sample-sample similarity and to identify potential batch effects within the experiment. Plots are generated for both circRNAs and RNA-Seq data when the differential expression analysis module has been selected by the user (see `--module` [documentation](https://nf-co.re/circrna/dev/parameters#pipeline-options)).

    * `Trimmed_Reads_MultiQC.html`: Summary reports of processed RNA-Seq reads.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. `nf-core` outputs HTML reports for sequencing read quality control.

## Genome Index Files

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `circrna_discovery/index/`
    * `bowtie/`: Directory containing `Bowtie` indices.
    * `bowtie2/`: Directory containing `Bowtie2` indices.

</details>

`nf-core/circrna` will automatically generate genome index files depending on the circRNA quantification tools selected for the `circrna_discovery` module. In subsequent workflow runs, users should specify the paths to the genome index files generated to save compute resources - please check `nf-core/circrna` [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/circrna/dev/parameters#reference-genome-options) for guidance on how to do this.

*N.B:* Index files must be regenerated if the user re-runs the analysis using different genome version.

## circRNA Quantification

### Miscellaneous Requirements

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `circrna_discovery/reference/chromosomes/`
    * `*.fa`: Individual FASTA files per chromosome.
* `circrna_discovery/ciriquant/`
    * `travis.yml`: Example of `.yml` file below which is automatically generated for the user.

  ```bash
  name: ciriquant
  tools:
   bwa:  /opt/conda/envs/nf-core-circrna-1.0dev/bin/bwa
   hisat2:  /opt/conda/envs/nf-core-circrna-1.0dev/bin/hisat2
   stringtie:  /opt/conda/envs/nf-core-circrna-1.0dev/bin/stringtie
   samtools: /opt/conda/envs/nf-core-circrna-1.0dev/bin/samtools

   hisat_index: /data/bdigby/results/circrna_discovery/index/hisat2/GRCh37
  ```

</details>

`CIRIquant` requires a `.yaml` file specifying the containerised paths of `BWA`, `SAMtools`, `HISAT2`, `StringTie` executables in addition to the absolute paths for the reference FASTA, GTF files and `BWA`, `HISAT2` genome index files.

`MapSplice` requires the reference FASTA file to be split into individual FASTA files per chromosome.

### CIRCexplorer2

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `circrna_discovery/tool_outputs/circexplorer2/${sample_id}/`
    * `*.STAR.junction.bed`: Intermediate file generated by `CIRCexplorer2 parse` module, identifying STAR fusion junctions for downstream annotation.
    * `*.txt`: Output files generated by `CIRCexplorer2 annotate` module, based on BED 12 format containing circRNA genomic location information, exon cassette composition and an additional 6 columns specifying circRNA annotations.  Full descriptions of the 18 columns can be found in the `CIRCexplorer2` [documentation](https://circexplorer2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/annotate/#output).

* `circrna_discovery/filtered_outputs/circexplorer2/`
    * `*_circexplorer2.bed`: Parsed `CIRCexplorer2` outputs in minimal BED file format. Low confidence circRNAs (BSJ reads < 2) have been removed.

</details>

[CIRCexplorer2](https://circexplorer2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) uses `*.Chimeric.out.junction` files generated from `STAR` 2 pass mode to extract back-splice junction sites using the `CIRCexplorer2 parse` module. Following this, `CIRCexplorer2 annotate` performs re-alignment of reads to the back-splice junction sites to determine the precise positions of downstream donor and upstream acceptor splice sites. Back-splice junction sites are subsequently updated and annotated using the customised annotation text file.

### circRNA finder

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `circrna_discovery/tool_outputs/circrna_finder/${sample_id}/`
    * `*.Chimeric.out.sorted.{bam,bam.bai}`: (Sorted and indexed) bam file with all chimeric reads identified by STAR. The circRNA junction spanning reads are a subset of these.
    * `*.filteredJunctions.bed`: A bed file with **all** circular junctions found by the pipeline. The score column indicates the number reads spanning each junction.
    * `*.s_filteredJunctions.bed`: A bed file with those junctions in `*.filteredJunctions.bed` that are flanked by GT-AG splice sites. The score column indicates the number reads spanning each junction.
    * `*.s_filteredJunctions_fw.bed`:  A bed file with the same circular junctions as in file (b), but here the score column gives the average number of forward spliced reads at both splice sites around each circular junction.

* `circrna_discovery/filtered_outputs/circrna_finder/`
    * `*_circrna_finder.bed`: Parsed `circrna_finder` outputs in minimal BED file format. Low confidence circRNAs (BSJ reads < 2) have been removed.

</details>

[circRNA finder](https://github.com/orzechoj/circRNA_finder) uses `*.Chimeric.out.sam`, `*.Chimeric.out.junction` & `*.SJ.out.tab` files to identify circular RNAs in RNA-Seq data.

### CIRIquant

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `circrna_discovery/tool_outputs/ciriquant/${sample_id}/`
    * `*.log`: A `CIRIerror.log` file which should be empty, and a `${sample_id}.log` file which contains the output log of `CIRIquant`.
    * `*.bed`: `CIRI2` output file in BED 6 format.
    * `*.gtf`: Output file from `CIRIquant` in GTF format. Full description of the columns available in the `CIRIquant` [documentation](https://ciriquant-cookbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quantification.html#output-format).

* `circrna_discovery/filtered_outputs/ciriquant/`
    * `*_ciriquant.bed`: Parsed `CIRIquant` outputs in minimal BED file format. Low confidence circRNAs (BSJ reads < 2) have been removed.

</details>

[CIRIquant](https://github.com/Kevinzjy/CIRIquant) operates by aligning RNA-Seq reads using `HISAT2` and [CIRI2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ciri/files/CIRI2/) to identify putative circRNAs. Next, a pseudo reference index is generated using `bwa index` by concatenating the two full-length sequences of the putative back-splice junction regions. Candidate circular reads are re-aligned against this pseudo reference using `bwa mem`, and back-splice junction reads are determined if they can be linearly and completely aligned to the putative back-splice junction regions.

### DCC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `/circrna_discovery/tool_outputs/dcc/${sample_id}/`
    * `*CircCoordinates`: Circular RNA annotations in BED format. Full description of the columns are available in the `DCC` [documentation](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/DCC#output-files-generated-by-dcc).
    * `*CircRNACount`: A table containing read counts for circRNAs detected.
    * `mate1/`: Output directory of STAR 2nd pass alignment for R1.
    * `mate2/`: Output directory of STAR 2nd pass alignment for R2.
* `circrna_discovery/filtered_outputs/dcc/`
    * `*_dcc.bed`: Parsed `DCC` outputs in minimal BED file format. Low confidence circRNAs (BSJ reads < 2) have been removed.

</details>

[DCC](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/DCC) identifies back-splice junction sites from `*Chimeric.out.junction`, `*SJ.out.tab` & `*Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam` files generated by `STAR` 2 pass mode, mapping the paired end reads both jointly and separately (`STAR` does not output read pairs that contain more than one chimeric junction thus a more granular approach is taken by `DCC` to fully characterise back-splice junctions in reads).

`DCC` then performs a series of filtering steps on candidate circular reads:

1. Mapping of mates must be consistent with a circular RNA template i.e align to the back-splice junction.
2. Filtering by a minimum number of junction reads per replicate (`nf-core/circrna` has set this parameter to`-Nr 1 1` allowing all reads).
3. Circular reads are not allowed span more than one gene.
4. Circular reads aligning to mitochondrial genome are removed.
5. Circular reads that lack a canonical (GT/AG) splicing signal at the circRNA junction borders are removed.

### find circ

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `circrna_discovery/tool_outputs/find_circ/${sample_id}/`
    * `*_anchors.qfa.gz`: 20mer anchors extracted from unmapped reads.
    * `*_unmapped.bam`: Unmapped RNA-Seq reads to reference genome.
    * `*.sites.bed`: Output from `find_circ`, first six columns are in standard BED format. A description of the remaining columns is available in the `find_circ` [documentation](https://github.com/marvin-jens/find_circ#output-format).
    * `*.sites.log`: Summary statistics of candidate circular reads in the sample.
    * `*.sites.reads`: Tab delimited file containing circRNA ID & sequence.
* `circrna_discovery/filtered_outputs/find_circ/`
    * `*_find_circ.bed`: Parsed `find_circ` outputs in minimal BED file format. Low confidence circRNAs (BSJ reads < 2) have been removed.

</details>

[find circ](https://github.com/marvin-jens/find_circ) utilises `Bowtie2` short read mapper to align RNA-Seq reads to the genome. Reads that align fully and contiguously are discarded. Unmapped reads are converted to 20mers and aligned independently to find unique anchor positions within spliced exons - anchors that align in reverse orientation indicate circular RNA junctions. Anchor alignments are extended and must meet the following criteria:

1. Breakpoints flanked by GT/AG splice sites.
2. Unambiguous breakpoint detection.
3. Maximum 2 mismatches in extension procedure.
4. Breakpoint cannot reside more than 2nt inside a 20mer anchor.
5. 2 reads must support the junction.

### MapSplice

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `circrna_discovery/tool_outputs/mapsplice/${sample_id}/`
    * `alignments.bam`: Bam file containing aligned reads and fusion alignments.

    * `Fusion output files`:
        * `fusions_raw.txt`: raw fusion junctions without filtering
        * `fusion_candidates.txt`: filtered fusion junctions  
        * `fusions_well_annotated.txt`:  annotated fusion junction candidates (align to annotation file provided)
        * `fusions_not_well_annotated.txt`: fusions that do not align with supplied annotations
    * `circular_RNAs.txt`: circular RNAs reported.
    * `insertions.txt`: Report of Insertions.
    * `junctions.txt`: Reported splice junctions.
    * `stats.txt`: Read alignment, Junction statistics.

</details>

[MapSplice](http://www.netlab.uky.edu/p/bioinfo/MapSplice2) first splits reads into segments, and maps them to reference genome by using `Bowtie`. `MapSplice` attempts to fix unmapped segments as gapped alignments, with each gap corresponding to a splice junction. Finally a remapping step is used to identify back-spliced alignments that are in the presence of small exons.

### STAR

<summary>Output files</summary>

* `circrna_discovery/tool_outputs/STAR/1st_Pass/${sample_id}/`
    * `*.Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam`: Coordinate sorted bam file containing aligned reads and chimeric reads.
    * `*.Chimeric.out.junction`: Each line contains the details of chimerically aligned reads. Full descriptions of columns can be found in `STAR` [documentation](https://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/skrabanek/lab/angsd/lecture_notes/STARmanual.pdf) (section 5.4).
    * `*.Chimeric.out.sam`: Chimeric alignments in SAM format.

* `circrna_discovery/tool_outputs/STAR/2nd_Pass/${sample_id}/`
    * `*.Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam`: Coordinate sorted bam file containing aligned reads and chimeric reads.
    * `*.Chimeric.out.junction`: Each line contains the details of chimerically aligned reads. Full descriptions of columns can be found in `STAR` [documentation](https://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/skrabanek/lab/angsd/lecture_notes/STARmanual.pdf) (section 5.4).
    * `*.Chimeric.out.sam`: Chimeric alignments in SAM format.
    * `*.Log.final.out`:  Summary mapping statistics after mapping job is complete, useful for quality control. The statistics are calculated for each read (single- or paired-end) and then summed or averaged over all reads.

* `circrna_discovery/tool_outputs/STAR/SJFile/`
    * `*.SJFile.tab`: Chromosome, start, end & strand coordinates of novel splice junctions.

</details>

[STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) can characterise novel splice junctions in RNA-Seq data by specifying `--ChimOutType Junctions`, with reported novel junctions written to a `*SJ.out.tab` file (per sample). Following the initial `STAR` alignment, a 2nd pass strategy is employed whereby **all** `*SJ.out.tab` files from RNA-Seq samples are converted to `*SJFile.tab` files of novel junction coordinates and provided during the 2nd alignment step via `--sjdbFileChrStartEnd`.

This achieves the highest sensitivity for novel junction alignment. For instance, if there is a novel junction that's highly expressed (many reads, confident detection) in the wild-type, but only weakly expressed (few reads) in the experimental group, by using junctions detected in all samples for the 2nd pass, `STAR` will detect lowly expressed spliced reads in the experimental group.

## circRNA Annotation

### Annotated circRNAs

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `circrna_discovery/annotated/`
    * `circrnas_annotated.txt`: Master file containing circRNA_ID, Type, Mature_Length, Parent_Gene & Strand for all circRNAs.

</details>

`nf-core/circrna` utilises filtered BED outputs from circRNA quantification tools and performs circRNA annotation using a filtered GTF file (biotypes not involved in circRNA biogenesis are removed). circRNA mature spliced length, parent gene and circRNA type are calculated using a customised script.

### BED12 Files

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `circrna_discovery/bed12/`
    * `*_bed12.bed`: Columns described in `BEDtools` [documentation](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/general-usage.html#bed-format). Note that the itemRGB column has been replaced with circRNA type.

</details>

`nf-core/circrna` outputs each filtered circRNA in BED12 format. Initially an intermediate file used for calculating the mature spliced sequence of circRNAs, the user may wish to concatenate the individual BED12 files into a master file for visualisation in IGV.

### Count Matrix

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `circrna_discovery/count_matrix/`
    * `matrix.txt`: Raw circRNA read counts for all samples in matrix format.

</details>

`nf-core/circrna` produces a counts matrix of circRNA read counts for each sample. circRNAs with BSJ reads < 2 have been removed during the quantification step, with a further filtering step included depending on the number of quantification tools selected. If the user has selected more than one circRNA quantification tool, `nf-core/circrna` will demand that a circRNA be called by at least two quantification tools or else it is removed. This approach is recommended to reduce the number of false positives.

### Fasta

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `circrna_discovery/fasta/`
    * `*.fa`: Mature spliced sequence of circRNAs.  

</details>

`nf-core/circrna` produces the mature spliced sequence of circRNAs in fasta format. Note that `nf-core/circrna` assumes for `circRNA type: circRNA` that all introns are removed from the mature sequence. For `circRNA type: EIciRNA` if the start/end of the circRNA falls outside 200nt of an annotated exon, the entire circRNA sequence (both exonic and intronic) is assumed to be in the mature splice length. If the `EIciRNA` falls within 200nt of an annotated exon, `nf-core/circrna` attempts to re-fit the circRNA as `circRNA type: circRNA` and all introns are removed from the sequence.

## miRNA Prediction

### miRanda

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `mirna_prediction/miranda/`
    * `*.miRanda.txt`: Raw outputs from `miRanda`.

</details>

[miRanda](http://cbio.mskcc.org/miRNA2003/miranda.html) performs miRNA target prediction of a genomic sequence against a miRNA database in 2 phases:

1. First a dynamic programming local alignment is carried out between the query miRNA sequence and the reference  sequence. This alignment procedure scores based on sequence complementarity and not on sequence identity.
2. Secondly, the algorithm takes high-scoring alignments detected from phase 1 and estimates the thermodynamic stability of RNA duplexes based on these alignments. This second phase of the method utilises folding routines from the `RNAlib` library,  part of the [ViennaRNA](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/) package.

### TargetScan

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `mirna_prediction/targetscan/`
    * `*.targetscan.txt`: Raw outputs from `TargetScan`.

</details>

[TargetScan](http://www.targetscan.org/vert_72/) predicts biological targets of miRNAs by searching for the presence of conserved 8mer, 7mer, and 6mer sites within the circRNA mature sequence that match the seed region of each miRNA.

### miRNA targets

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `mirna_prediction/mirna_targets/`
    * `*_miRNA_targets.txt`: Filtered target miRNAs of circRNAs called by quantification tools. Columns are self explanatory: miRNA, Score, Energy_KcalMol, Start, End, Site_type.

</details>

`nf-core/circrna` performs miRNA target filtering on `miRanda` and `TargetScan` predictions:

1. miRNA must be called by both `miRanda` and `TargetScan`.
2. `6mer` site predictions are removed from `TargetScan` output. `nf-core/circrna` requires:
     * `7mer-m8`: An exact match to positions 2-8 of the mature miRNA (the seed + position 8).
     * `7mer-A1`: An exact match to positions 2-7 of the mature miRNA (the seed) followed by an 'A'.
     * `8-mer`: An exact match to positions 2-8 of the mature miRNA (the seed + position 8) followed by an 'A'.
3. Removal of miRNAs with minimum free energy of <= -20.00 Kcal/Mol as calculated by `ViennaRNA`.
4. If a site within the circRNA mature sequence shares duplicate miRNA ID's overlapping the same coordinates, the miRNA with the highest score is kept.

### Circos Plot

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `mirna_prediction/circos_plots/`
    * `*_miRNA_Plot.pdf`: Circos plot of mature spliced circRNA sequence with exon boundaries where applicable, displaying miRNA binding sites.
  <p markdown="1" align="center">
  <img src="images/output/miRNA/circos_plot.png" alt="circRNA - miRNA circos plot" width="500">
  </p>

</details>

`nf-core/circrna` plots the filtered miRNA targets given using a circos plot, displaying the miRNA response elements along the mature circRNA sequence. Please note this plot becomes overcrowded when plotting `EIciRNAs` due to their highly variable sequence length (in contrast to `circRNAs` and `ciRNAs` which typically fall within the range of 100 - 1000nt). Therefore `EIciRNAs` with large mature spliced lengths should be considered as potentially spurious calls.

## Differential Expression Analysis

`nf-core/circrna` will perform differential expression analysis by contrasting every variable within the `condition` column i.e the response variable.

| samples | condition |
|---------|-----------|
| control_rep1  | control   |
| control_rep2  | control   |
| control_rep3  | control   |
| lung_rep1  | lung      |
| lung_rep2  | lung      |
| lung_rep3  | lung      |
| melanoma_rep1  | melanoma  |
| melanoma_rep2  | melanoma  |
| melanoma_rep3  | melanoma  |

The above experimental design will produce the `DESeq2` design formula `~ condition` and loop through the nested factors within `condition` producing outputs for `control_vs_lung`, `control_vs_melanoma`, `lung_vs_control`, `lung_vs_melanoma`, `melanoma_vs_control` and `melanoma_vs_lung`, capturing every possible contrast.

*N.B:* In the phenotype file the response variable must be called `condition`, these values are hard-coded in the automated differential expression analysis R script.
